                A thermocouple is a temperature-measuring device that consists of two wires made of
                 different metals joined at one end to form a junction. This junction, when exposed
                  to a <strong>temperature difference</strong>temperature difference, generates a small voltage due to the Seebeck effect, 
                  which can be measured to determine the temperature.

                A hydraulic cylinder is a mechanical actuator that converts hydraulic energy into linear 
                mechanical motion. It's a key component in hydraulic systems, using pressurized hydraulic 
                fluid to generate force for pushing, pulling, or lifting loads. These cylinders are used
                 in a wide variety of applications, from heavy machinery to industrial automation
